# MultielectrodeArrayDataVisualization
As part of my PhD thesis work, I collected multi-electrode array recordings from dissociated hippocampal cell cultures from Sprague Dawley rats using a tool provided by Multichannelsystems (MCS). However the data visualization from this MCS tool was very basic and did not meet my project needs. Therefore  I developed my own data visualization tool in csharp using APIs provided from Multichannel systems.

All the "Form" objects (eg Form1.cs, frmFileExport.cs) along with the functionality were created by me to visualize the data. Also find in this project space, sample screenshots of my visual interface developed.
