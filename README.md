# MultielectrodeArrayDataVisualization
As part of my PhD thesis work, I collected multi-electrode array recordings from dissociated hippocampal cell cultures from Sprague Dawley rats using a tool provided by Multichannelsystems (MCS). However the data visualization from this MCS tool was very basic and did not meet my project needs. Therefore  I developed my own data visualization tool in csharp using APIs provided from Multichannel systems
